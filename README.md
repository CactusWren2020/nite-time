NITE-TIME is an html/css layout. Dark-themed, subtle, it's when you want to present your content with a bit of flair. It includes standard UI such as a 3-box row, a slideshow, and a grid to give customers a quick idea of what you do.

In the footer is a 6-img ribbon for even more display options.

Here is a deployment showing the desktop layout without any images.
